# Seinfeld
_Description_:

Uses Hummingbird Duo kit and Python to play randomized Seinfeld bass riffs whenever a door is opened.

_Materials_:
- Hummingbird Duo Bit Controller
- Hummingbird Duo Light Sensor
- Hummingbird Duo Distance Sensor

_Summary_:

My first attempt used the distance sensor to recognize when the door was opening, however I realized that it was difficult for the sensor to read the distance of the door while it was moving. This resulted in it working occasionally and only when the door was opening very slowly. I switched gears and put a light sensor in the top of the doorway and when it sensed a certain amount of light (meaning the door was opening), the bass riff would play. Victory never sounded so funky!
